The Ship class functions as the subject (observable), while the PirateShip instances serve as observers that track and respond to ship's movements. This pattern enables the pirates to dynamically adjust their behavior based on the ship's position rather than having the Ship directly notify the pirates of its movements. This approach provides flexibility for future enhancements, such as adding new observer types .
